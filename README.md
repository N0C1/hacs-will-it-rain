A modern Home Assistant integration that provides rain forecasts based on the Open-Meteo API. Simple "Yes/No" sensors with a global threshold, plus detailed probability sensors for flexible automations.

## Why This Integration?

**The Problem:** Home Assistant's built-in weather integrations are great for general weather data, but they're frustrating when you need specific rain predictions for automations:

-  **Generic weather states** like "rainy" don't tell you *when* rain will start
-  **No probability thresholds** - you can't say "close awning when rain is 80% likely"  
-  **No time-specific forecasts** - will it rain in the next hour or next day?
-  **Complex setup** for simple questions like "should I water the garden?"

**The Solution:** This integration gives you exactly what you need for smart home automations:

- ✅ **Simple Yes/No answers** - "Will it rain in the next 2 hours?" 
- ✅ **Your own threshold** - Define what "likely" means to you (30%? 60%? 80%?)
- ✅ **Multiple time horizons** - 1h for awnings, 24h for garden planning
- ✅ **Flexible automation options** - Use simple triggers or custom probability values

## Features

- **Rain forecast** for 6 different time periods (1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, 24h)
- **3 sensor types** per time period:
  - Main sensor: "Yes/No" based on configurable threshold
  - Probability sensor: Exact percentage value
  - Precipitation sensor: Expected precipitation amount in mm
- **Automatic location detection** using Home Assistant coordinates
- **Flexible location input**: City names, coordinates, or predefined cities
- **Easy configuration** through Home Assistant UI
- **Multi-language support**: German and English
- **Asynchronous architecture** with modern DataUpdateCoordinator implementation
- **Automatic updates** every 10 minutes

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right and select "Custom repositories"
4. Add `https://github.com/n0c1/hacs-will-it-rain`
5. Select "Integration" as category
6. Click "Add"
7. Search for "Will It Rain" and install it
8. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/will_it_rain` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to "Settings" → "Devices & Services" → "Add Integration"
4. Search for "Will It Rain"

## Configuration

1. Go to "Settings" → "Devices & Services" → "Add Integration"
2. Search for "Will It Rain" and click on it
3. Configure the integration:
   - **Location**: City, coordinates (lat,lon) or 'home' for Home Assistant location
   - **Rain probability threshold (%)**: This sets the threshold for your Yes/No sensors (default: 40%)
     - If probability ≥ threshold → `sensor.rain_1h` shows "Yes"
     - If probability < threshold → `sensor.rain_1h` shows "No"
     - You can always use `sensor.rain_probability_1h` for custom thresholds in automations

### Location Input Guide

- **`home`** - Uses your Home Assistant location (recommended)
- **City name** - e.g., `Vienna`, `Munich`, `London`
- **Coordinates** - e.g., `47.2692,11.4041` (latitude,longitude)

## Lovelace Examples

**🌧️ Window Alert Cards:**

```yaml
# Close Windows Card (Rain Coming)
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: sensor.rain_2h
    state: "Yes"
card:
  type: entity
  entity: sensor.rain_2h
  name: "⚠️ Close Windows!"
  icon: mdi:window-close
  state_color: true

# Keep Windows Open Card (No Rain)  
type: conditional
conditions:
  - entity: sensor.rain_2h
    state: "No"
card:
  type: entity
  entity: sensor.rain_2h
  name: "✅ Windows Safe to Stay Open"
  icon: mdi:window-open
  state_color: true
```

**📊 Simple Overview:**
```yaml
type: entities
title: Rain Forecast
entities:
  - entity: sensor.rain_1h
    name: "1h"
  - entity: sensor.rain_4h
    name: "4h"
  - entity: sensor.rain_24h
    name: "24h"
```
